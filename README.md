# Heart_Disease prediction-🫀
This project presents a Heart Disease Prediction System built using machine learning techniques to assist in the early diagnosis of heart-related conditions. The model predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and other health metrics.

🚀 Features
Built using Python and key ML libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib
Implements multiple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and more
Trained on the popular Heart Disease Dataset
Interactive visualizations for data insights and model performance
Includes performance evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix

🎯 Goals
Raise awareness of data-driven medical diagnostics
Highlight the importance of early detection in saving lives

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
Streamlit
